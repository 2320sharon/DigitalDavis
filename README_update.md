# Digital Davis Senior Project

[gif goes here]

## Project Overview
This app was developed for the CIO of Davis as part of Sacramento State's requirement for Computer Science students to complete a senior project. This app named Nirvana was developed with the SCRUM development process over a year for the Digital Davis initative. The app allows users to create and join various health related challenges.  The development team of 8 Computer Science seniors developed Nirvana with the MERN stack and cross platform capabilites (functions on both IOS and android) by developing with React Native. The app was fully dockerized, so it could be hosted and developed further in any environment. All the developers on the team had no prior experience developing cross platform apps and opon the conclusion of the project the app was recieved with praise by Davis.

## ‚≠ê Highlights :star:
1. MERN stack
2. Cross Platform Compatbility with React Native
3. Full Docker Containment
5. Full Testing Suite
6. SCRUM Development Process


## 1. MERN stack
Nirvana was developed using a modified version of the MERN stack which stands for: 
M - MongoDB - document database
E- Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
R- React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework (Nirvanna utilizes React Native for the front end instead)
N- Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

The Mern stack is commonly used in industry hence why our team decided to use it.
